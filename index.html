   	  	   <div class="card">
   	  	  	 <p>I would describe myself as a very committed person, active in daily life, I am also very attentive and know how to react appropriately to the different situations that arise. I am diligent in my work and always looking to improve my skills. 
             Besides school and classes, I have other interests, like listening to music, spending time with my friends, and taking care of both my cats. I also enjoy photography and fighting sports (Thai boxing, mma).

   	       <div class="card">
   	       	 <p>Over the next five years in the Grande Ã‰cole Programme at IESEG, I aim to deepen my skills in management and business strategy. I also want to do internships abroad like in USA or even Japan to expand my professional network. Finally, I am considering additional certifications to strengthen my future profile in the labour market. My goal is to become an innovative and adaptable professional. As the slogan says; Empowering changemakers for a better society! </p>

   	       <h2>3.My program</h2>
   	       <div class="card">
   	       	 <p>For the next 5 years in PGE, I will learn a lot of things that I hope will bring me more experiences. At the moment, the subjects I study in my first year are very varied, which allows me to discover as much as possible. However, the ones I like most are macroeconomics, microeconomics, law, and also business exploration. </p>
